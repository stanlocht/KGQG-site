									<h2>What are knowledge graphs?</h2>
									<p>During these last years, the presence of video cameras in public spaces has widely increased,

										control over their own personal information in these scenarios.

									<p>The GDPR defines personal data as any kind of information that can lead to the identification of an individual,
										on its own or in combination with other data. There are several personal identifiers that could be found in a video or
										image, which are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0923596516300856"  target="_blank">typically
											classified among three types</a>: biometric (faces, gait), soft biometric (body silhouette,

									<h3>How can we pose questions from graphs?</h3>
									<p>Considering the kind of scenario that can be found in the surroundings of the Paaspop festival, or in a general outdoors street scene,
										6 different classes of objects were defined as potentially sensitive:
									people, and several vehicles that could be linked to their drivers' or riders' identities
									 (cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks and buses).</p>
									<p>To automatically find them and locate them, an object detection algorithm is needed. Three well-known state-of-the-art detectors
									are <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8372616" target="_blank">Mask R-CNN</a>
									(which proposes several regions in an image that could potentially contain objects, to later classify them and segment them),
									<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767" target="_blank">YOLOv3</a> and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8417976" target="_blank">RetinaNet</a>
									(both of which perform both region division and classification together). YOLOv3 enables real-time application, but Mask R-CNN offers a higher accuracy.
									RetinaNet was created with the purpose of combining real-time execution with a higher accuracy. Although RetinaNet outperforms both YOLOv3 and Mask R-CNN in
									identical conditions, Mask R-CNN is the only method that performs object segmentation.</p>

									<h3>How can we remove or process personal data in a video?</h3>
									<p>There are several existing methods for processing sensitive areas in images and videos. The most typical approach is to apply image filters, such as
									<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7026221/" target="_blank">blurring (a), pixelating (b), warping (c)</a>, <a
									href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84882-301-3_8" target="_blank">morphing (d)</a>
									 or <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6343472" target="_blank">masking (e)</a>, for processing specific regions
									 like human faces or license plates.
									As these are not the only areas displaying personal data, image filters could be applied to larger areas, such as the whole human body.
									We as humans, however, are capable of recognizing individuals even through these filters.</p>
									<p>Other approaches also involve some disadvantages for our specific use case. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1117/12.587986" target="_blank">Object removal (f)</a> would prevent us from preserving relevant information;
									and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2006.184" target="_blank">encryption of image regions (g)</a>, by means of pixels scrambling, can be reversed by using the corresponding key,
									meaning that GDPR would still apply.</p>
									<p>All these techniques have, in fact, something in common: they all manipulate the original video in some way. The problem of this approach is that,
									if the intention is to automate the anonymization process, the detection of sensitive areas would have to be perfect. If the detection and
									subsequent image processing failed for even just a single video frame, the privacy of the recorded individuals would be compromised.</p>

						<div class="inner">
							<h2>Proposed method</h2>
							<p>Instead of following the general approach of manipulating the original video frame images,
								our proposed method aims at <b>estimating the locations of the relevant
								 objects (people and vehicles) within the scene in the 3D space, at each frame</b>.
							 These estimated locations can be used, for instance, to recreate the scene in a 3D animation,
						 where all the objects of the same type are represented using an identical default 3D model.</p>
						 <p>This approach follows the trend set by a few existing privacy-preserving techniques,
							  focused on using alternative information sources instead of the original video feed.
							 Some examples are the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31522-0_95" target="_blank">usage of RGBD (Red-Color-Green-Depth)
								 cameras and the removal of the RGB color components</a>,
							 or the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4653063/" target="_blank">usage of positional metadata based on GPS sensor measurements</a>.
						 The usage of 3D avatars for anonymization has been proposed before <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2015.01.041" target="_blank">as
							  a theoretical solution</a>, but has not been
					 implemented yet prior to this project.</p>
							<p>This way, only the position and motion information is preserved, guaranteeing the anonymity of
								the recreated scene while also providing sufficient information of the original scene for further analysis.</p>

										<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/output_example1.png" alt="High-level functioning of the method" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
							<p>To achieve this, we make use of the following techniques and tools:</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-object-ungroup"></span>
									<h3>Object detection: Mask R-CNN</h3>
									<p>... to find and locate all the objects of interest to us: people, and certain vehicles
										(cars, motorcycles, bicycles, buses and trucks).
										<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8372616" target="_blank">Mask R-CNN</a>
										 proposes regions in an image with a high chance of containing a certain object. Once it is confident that
										 there is an object in a certain region, it classifies it and adjusts the region contour for a more precise
										 localization of the object. It also performs
										 object segmentation, indicating which pixels actually belong to each object.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-wave-square"></span>
									<h3>Object tracking: DeepSORT</h3>
									<p>... to identify all the objects throughout the video sequence, by associating the
									detected objects to themselves in subsequent frames. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07402.pdf" target="_blank">DeepSORT</a> is able to perform this association
								based on both motion assumptions (such as expected positions or speed) and on appearance similarity. Object tracking helps
							filter out potentially false positive detections (e.g. if an object was not found in any other frame) and smooth object trajectories:
							for instance, if an object is fully occluded at some point, its missing 3D location could be interpolated based
						on its previous and future estimated locations.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cube"></span>
									<h3>Depth estimation: MonoDepth</h3>
									<p>... to infer the distance to the camera of every 2D image point or pixel, within each video frame.
										<a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Godard_Unsupervised_Monocular_Depth_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf" target="_blank">MonoDepth</a>
									does this by predicting how the paired image to the input image would look like in a stereo camera setup (that is, a 3D camera).
									From these images, it outputs a disparity map, which indicates the displacement of each 2D point relative to itself
								in the other image. If we know certain camera parameters, we can compute depth from the disparity map by using geometry
								and the concept of triangle similarity.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-video"></span>
									<h3>Camera self-calibration: estimation of vanishing points</h3>
									<p>... to estimate the camera parameters we need to convert 2D images to 3D, directly from the recorded video sequence.
									As our goal is to make the method transparent to the user's input, we do not know -or have access to- the camera that was used to record
								the video. Based on a modified version of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899644" target="_blank">this method</a>, we compute the
							camera parameters from vanishing points (image points where parallel lines in the real world intersect). We find candidate vanishing points by locating the head and feet of
						a certain tracked person (whose height is assumed to be constant) and intersecting head-to-head, feet-to-feet and head-to-feet lines.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-ruler-combined"></span>
									<h3>3D reconstruction: epipolar geometry</h3>
									<p>... to calculate the 3D world coordinates of every 2D image point, once the depth components and the camera
										parameters have been estimated. Epipolar geometry models the geometry of stereo cameras, and establishes the relationships
									and constraints among 3D points and their projections on a 2D image. Similarly to how depth was computed based on the disparity maps,
								<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2523356" target="_blank">the remaining coordinates can be calculated</a>. For each object, we select a group of points from its center area, and average
							their 3D coordinates to obtain an estimate of the objects' locations on the ground plane.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-walking"></span>
									<h3>3D animation: Unity</h3>
									<p>... to generate an alternative version of the video, by means of a 3D animation where objects are represented
									with default 3D models depending on their object class. As a proof-of-concept, we integrated our final output (objects'
									locations on the ground plane) in a 3D environment created with the <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity game engine</a>.</p>

							<h2>Results</h2>

							 autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>For
							 demonstration and evaluation purposes, we make use of this video sequence named <i>TUD-Stadtmitte</i>. It was
							 taken from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01942" target="_blank"><i>MOT Challenge</i></a>
 								tracking benchmark. It contains ground truth annotations of the 3D locations of the objects
 								throughout the video, which were captured thanks to a multiple-camera setup.<br></p>

								<h3>Object detection</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/results/demo_detection.png" alt="" /></span><br>
									Mask R-CNN displays a highly accurate detection of the people in <i>TUD-Stadtmitte</i>,
								with high levels of confidence, and a reliable detection and segmentation even with severe occlusions.<br><br>
							Mask R-CNN gives a mean average precision of 20.1%
							when evaluated on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2016.350" target="_blank" alt="Object detection results"><i>Cityscapes</i></a> dataset,
						considering our 6 selected object classes only. Although this value is significantly lower than its theoretical mean
					average precision, Mask R-CNN still provides a state-of-the-art performance, specifically for our objects of interest and in a
					setting similar to our expected ones (outdoors street scene, displaying people and vehicles), such as the ones
				shown in <i>Cityscapes</i>.</p>

				<h3>Object tracking</h3>
				<p><span class="image right"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v98vbZZJZDs?rel=0" width="90%" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay;
					encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>DeepSORT provides a fairly robust tracking
					of the detected objects, and a relatively consistent assignment of the object IDs, with a low number of identity switches.
				Even when objects are fully occluded and disappear from the frame, they are mostly correctly identified afterwards.<br><br>
				When evaluating the final output of the system, the usage of tracking increased the overall accuracy by 15% on the test
				setting as opposed to when tracking was not used. </p>

				<h3>Depth estimation</h3>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/results/demo_depth.png" alt="" /></span>MonoDepth was trained on
					several datasets and combinations of them, with data mainly obtained from <i>Cityscapes</i>. We evaluated it on the
					<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6248074" target="_blank"><i>KITTI</i></a> dataset, similar to <i>Cityscapes</i> in terms of viewpoint and scene content. We obtained relatively
					low error rates, with a root-mean-square error of 4.58.<br><br>
					However, when we analyzed its performance on videos that visibly differed from the training data
					(particularly in viewpoint and camera height),
					the depth maps presented several artifacts, added to the lack of temporal consistency of the method.
					Both the objects and the background showed
					incongruities in their depth maps. Particularly, the areas belonging to objects labeled
					as <i>person</i> yielded larger errors, with a root-mean-square error that doubled its value compared to
					when the areas belonging to all relevant objects were considered</p>

					<!-- self-calibration -->
					<h3>Camera self-calibration</h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4luTQAYqoE" width="90%" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
					autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>Despite the simplifications
					done to the original method in aspects like optimization, we were also able to include certain improvements, such as
					the direct usage of the detected objects and their segmentation masks obtained with Mask R-CNN. These masks provided us
					with more accurate locations of the head and feet of the reference person, ultimately obtaining more reliable candidate
					vanishing points.<br><br>
					Due to the actual nature of the method, nevertheless, the results were highly influenced by the adequacy of the selected
					reference person. If this person moved around the scene along the 3 axes, the candidate vanishing points provided a better
					overview of the 3D space, yielding more perceptually accurate horizon lines.</p>

						</div>
					</div>

					<!-- 3D reconstruction (results final output) -->
					<h3>3D reconstruction</h3>
					<p>Finally, we obtained the estimated locations
						of the objects over the ground plane, by applying epipolar geometry using the depth maps of each of the video frames,
						and the camera parameters obtained through the self-calibration process. We visualize them on a 2D plot that represents
						the ground plane. Each point in the plot corresponds to an object, and the legend indicates the object class corresponding
						to each of these estimated objects, based on a color code.

						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						While the presence of the objects and the directionality of their movement is preserved, it is noticeable how the
						large outliers in the estimated depth component (y-axis) affects the final output, causing a drastic flickering along
						this axis. This flickering is even stronger when the objects reach the sides of the image, to either enter or leave the frame.
					</p>
					<p>
						This situation is also captured when making use of multi-object tracking metrics. An accuracy of 60% is obtained but
						at the cost of a distance precision of 1.6 meters over the ground plane. When only the x-axis is taken into account,
						without considering the depth component, this accuracy raises until 70% with a much better precision of 0.45 meters.

					<!-- Unity PoC -->
					<h3>3D animation</h3>
					<p>
						Once we have estimated the locations of the objects on the ground plane, we can generate the trajectories to animate
						default 3D models within a 3D environment, in a 3D graphics engine or a game engine.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a proof-of-concept, we make use of our estimated object locations for the <i>TUD-Stadtmitte</i> sequence
						to animate 3D <i>person</i> models in a basic environment in Unity:

							<h2>Future work</h2>
							<p>Currently, the main limitation of the method is the low accuracy and reliability of the depth estimation process.

							<p>For future versions or continuation of this research, there are certain improvements that could be made.
								First, if the intention of anonymizing a video is...</p>

								<h3>... known prior to its recording:</h3>
								<p>Make use of a multi-camera or stereo camera setup, an RGBD (depth) camera,

									<p>Make use of an alternative depth estimation method, that ideally also takes the time domain into account.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<p>In addition, the object tracking algorithm that was used is an online technique, meaning that it only sees the previous
						frames of the video and not future frames. Regardless of the prior knowledge (or lack thereof) of the intention to anonymize
						a video,
						the object tracking algorithm could be improved or substituted. As real-time execution is not needed in principle,
						an online tracker could be used, with looks through all the frames
						in the video from the beginning, for a more consistent object identification; or a tracker
						based on the association of segmentation masks, instead of the detection boxes, further exploiting the features of the
